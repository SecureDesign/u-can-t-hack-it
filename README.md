###Original Project:

U Hack It!
An interactive tutorial on website security issues - a hackable website deployed on hack.me

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate how poor web programming practices expose serious security vulnerabilities to would-be hackers.

Thus, this code should NOT, under any circumstance, be used on a real website.

- INSTALLATION:

1) Create a MySQL DB (other DBMS may work, but not tested) - edit DB name, user, p/w into class-db.php - all tables are created by app as required.

2) If you are using ```.htaccess mod_rewrite, you can (optionally) use clean URL's setting in app-init.php Otherwise, ensure CLEAN_URLS is FALSE in app-init.php ``` (default setting for use on hack.me).

3) Install the app in htdocs, and point your browser at index.php

DEVELOPMENT:

Code is available at: https://github.com/powderflask/u-hack-it

Contributions welcome on following conditions:

this is a BASIC tutorial - examples should be aimed at students just learning about web development
each exploit is a simple lesson that allows student to exploit an intentional vulnerability - these are not challenges, they are lessons!
just because the coding is intentially sloppy doesn't mean the code itself should be!
How to build a new exploit:

add a new "template" to the exploits folder to describe the exploit and how to peform the hack
add a exploit item in app-init.php
any new php files should be added to app/ folder
